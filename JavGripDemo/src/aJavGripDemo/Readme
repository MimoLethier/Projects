JavGrip proposes a few "basic" tools written to ease taking a first grip on JavaFX :
  Popup window enabling information, alerts, and alternative settlement (yes/no...)
  Basic Logger 
  Basic access to Configuration properties
  Scene Framer,  a bit fancier Stage Decoration medium than the standard FXML windows... to plug between the PrimaryStage and its
  usual fxml Scene...
The main purpose, of course, is not to replace more mature/richly featured/tested in depth/portable anywhere tools, but to
provide examples of JavaFX/FXML/CSS interactions, flexibility and power... kind of playground for experimentations. Nothing
for the experimented JavaFX expert here, for sure!

JavGrip Demo integrates those tools in a working app that does pretty nothing, apart showing a chocolate-framed window with
an exit ("Bye...") and an Iconify ("Zzz...") buttons, and the notification Popup (click the Bye button...). Config is there, but
needs a config file (Demo uses default properties); similarly, a log is produced, but quite hollow...

Tools may be constructed as a Library package, and Demo as a Main JAVAFX with FXML application...
